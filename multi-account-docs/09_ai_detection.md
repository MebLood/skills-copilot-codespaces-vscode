# AI-Powered Detection Evasion

## Overview
Using AI to mimic human behavior can significantly improve detection evasion.

## Implementation
1. Train a **Reinforcement Learning (RL) model**.
2. Use AI to **adjust mouse and keyboard timings** dynamically.

## Next Steps
Proceed to Scalability & Performance Optimization.
