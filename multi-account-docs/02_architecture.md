# Architecture Design

## System Components
The system consists of multiple key components:
1. **Identity Isolation**: Using different IPs, devices, and browser configurations.
2. **Authentication Module**: Handling OTP, 2FA, and session management.
3. **Anti-Bot Protection**: Avoiding detection using AI-based behavior simulation.
4. **Scalability Management**: Using containerization and load balancing.

## High-Level Architecture
- **Frontend**: Web-based or CLI interface for managing accounts.
- **Backend**: Python-based automation scripts for account handling.
- **Database**: Redis for temporary session storage and MySQL/PostgreSQL for logs.
- **Infrastructure**: Docker & Kubernetes for managing multiple sessions.

## Next Steps
Proceed to the Identity Management module.
